            <h2>1. Expressions & Equations</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>1.1 Order of Operations:

When simplifying or evaluating a function, you should follow PEMDAS. 

You simplify anything in parentheses first, then you evaluate any exponents, then multiply/divide any variables or constants, then add/subtract variables and constants

P - Parentheses
E - Exponents
M - Multiply
D - Divide
A - Add
S - Subtract

Example 1:

(5-3) * 10 - 5

2 * 10 - 5 | Simplify the parentheses
20 - 5 | Multiply 2 * 10
15 | Evaluate 20-5
</li>

                <li>1.2 Expressions, Equations, and Inequalities:
When working with algebra, it’s important to know what type of mathematical statement you’re dealing with. Each one behaves differently.
Expression
A math phrase that does not have an equals sign.
 You can simplify it, but you cannot “solve” it.
Example:
3x+5
Equation
A mathematical statement that does have an equals sign.
 You can solve it to find the value of the variable.
Example:
3x+5=11
Inequality
A comparison using symbols like >, <, ≥, ≤.
 You can solve it to find a range of possible values.
Example:
3x+5>11
</li>

                <li>1.3 Functions as Rules & Tables:
A function is a rule that takes an input and produces exactly one output.
Function Rule
A function can be written as a rule using function notation.
Example:
f(x)=2x+3
This means:
Take the input x
Multiply by 2
Add 3
The result is the output f(x)
Function Table
A table shows several input → output pairs.
Example:
x | 0, 1, 2
f(x) | 3, 5, 7

You plug each x-value into the rule to get the output.
                </li>

                
                <li>1.4 Functions as Graphs:
A graph is another way to represent a function.
 Each point on the graph shows an input and its corresponding output.
Axes
x-axis = input
y-axis = output
Plotting a Function
To graph a function:
Choose a few x‑values
Use the rule to calculate f(x)
Plot the points (x,f(x))
Connect the points if the function is continuous
Example using f(x)=2x+3:
 Points: (0,3), (1,5), (2,7)
Plot these on the coordinate plane to form the graph of the function.

            <h2>2. Real Numbers</h2>
            <ul>
           <li>2.1 Real Numbers
Real numbers include all the numbers you work with in basic algebra.
 They can be positive, negative, whole, fractional, or decimal.
Examples of real numbers:
Whole numbers: 0, 1, 12
Integers: −5, 0, 7
Fractions: 3/4,-5/2
Decimals: 2.5, −0.8
Irrationals: pi, sqrt2
If it can be placed on a number line, it is a real number.
</li>
        
       <li>
        2.2 Adding & Subtracting Real Numbers
When adding or subtracting real numbers, the sign matters.
 Use these rules to determine the correct operation and sign.
Same Sign
-Add the numbers
-Keep the sign
Example:
-7+(-3)=-10
Different Signs
-Subtract the numbers
-Keep the sign of the number with the larger absolute value
Example:
8+(-5)=3
Example:
-12+7=-5
</li>    
       
  <li>
  2.3 Multiplying & Dividing Real Numbers
The sign of the answer depends on whether the signs match.
Same Sign → Positive
Positive × Positive = Positive
Negative × Negative = Positive
Example:
(-4)(-3)=12
Different Signs → Negative
Positive × Negative = Negative
Negative ÷ Positive = Negative
Example:
6 / (-2)=-3
</li>
<li>
2.4 Combining Like Terms & Distributing
Combining Like Terms
You can only combine terms that have the same variable and same exponent.
 Add or subtract the coefficients.
Example:
3x+5x=8x
Example:
7y-2y=5y
Distributive Property
-Multiply the outside number by each term inside the parentheses.
Formula:
a(b+c)=ab+ac
Example:
4(2x+3)=8x+12

            <h2>3. Solving Equations</h2>
            <ul>
            <li>3.1 One‑Step Equations
You solve a one‑step equation by undoing the operation that is being done to the variable.
 Use the opposite operation to isolate the variable.
If the equation adds → subtract
If it subtracts → add
If it multiplies → divide
If it divides → multiply
Example
x+5=12
Undo the +5 by subtracting 5 from both sides:
x=7
</li>

<li>3.2 Two‑Step Equations
Solve two‑step equations by undoing operations in reverse order of operations:
Undo addition or subtraction
Undo multiplication or division
Example
2x+3=11
Step 1: Subtract 3
2x=8
Step 2: Divide by 2
x=4
</li>

<li>3.3 Multi‑Step Equations
For longer equations, simplify before solving.
Steps:
Distribute if needed
Combine like terms
Then solve using one‑step or two‑step methods
Example structure:
4(x-2)+3x=25
→ distribute
 → combine like terms
 → solve
</li>

<li>3.4 Variables on Both Sides
When variables appear on both sides of the equation, your first goal is to move all variables to one side.
Steps:
Move variables to one side
Move constants to the other side
Solve normally
Example
2x+3=x+7
Step 1: Subtract x
x+3=7
Step 2: Subtract 3
x=4

            <ul>
            <li>4.1 Ratios and Proportions
A ratio compares two quantities.
 A proportion is an equation that states two ratios are equal.
Examples of ratios:
3/4
5 to 2
7:1
A proportion sets two ratios equal:
a/b = c/d
</li>
<li>
4.2 Solving Proportions with Cross Products
To solve a proportion, use cross multiplication.
 Multiply diagonally, then solve the resulting equation.
General form:
a/b =c/d
Cross multiply:
a * d =b * c
Then solve for the variable.

</li>
<li>4.3 Solving Percent Problems
Percent problems follow a simple pattern:
Convert the percent to a decimal
Multiply by the number
Solve if needed
Example
Find 20% of 50:
Convert 20% → 0.2
 Multiply:
0.2 * 50=10

    <h2>5. Linear Functions</h2>
    <ul>
       <li>5.1 Plotting Points in the Coordinate Plane
A point is written as (x,y).
x tells you how far to move left or right
y tells you how far to move up or down
To plot a point:
Start at the origin (0, 0)
Move x units left/right
Move y units up/down
Place the point
Example:
 (3,-2) → right 3, down 2
</li>
       <li>5.2 Graphing Linear Equations Using Intercepts
A line crosses the axes at two important points:
x‑intercept: where the line crosses the x‑axis (y = 0)
y‑intercept: where the line crosses the y‑axis (x = 0)
To graph using intercepts:
Plug in x = 0 to find the y‑intercept
Plug in y = 0 to find the x‑intercept
Plot both points
Connect them with a straight line
</li>
       <li>5.3 Rate of Change (Slope)
Slope measures how steep a line is.
 It tells you how much the y‑value changes when x changes.
Formula:
Slope = Rise / Run = (x_2 - x_1) / (y_2 - y_1)
Positive slope: line goes up
Negative slope: line goes down
Zero slope: horizontal line
Undefined slope: vertical line
</li>
       <li>5.4 Graphing Linear Equations in Slope‑Intercept Form
Slope‑intercept form:
y=mx+b
m = slope
b = y‑intercept
To graph:
Start at the y‑intercept b
Use the slope m to find another point
Rise = change in y
Run = change in x
Plot both points
Draw a straight line through them
Example:
 If m=2, go up 2 and right 1.
</li>
       <li>5.5 Graphing Linear Functions
You can graph a linear function in two main ways:
Method 1: Use a Table
Choose a few x‑values
Plug them into the function
Plot the points
Connect them with a straight line
Method 2: Use Slope and Intercept
Plot the y‑intercept
Use the slope to find another point
Draw the line

    <h2>6. Writing Linear Equations</h2>
    <ul>
       <li>6.1 Writing in Slope‑Intercept Form
Slope‑intercept form is written as:
y=mx+b
m = slope (rate of change)
b = y‑intercept (where the line crosses the y‑axis)
To write an equation in this form:
Identify the slope
Identify the y‑intercept
Substitute into y=mx+b
Example:
 Slope = 3, y‑intercept = −2
y=3x-2
</li>
       <li>6.2 Using Equations in Slope‑Intercept Form
Once you have an equation in the form y=mx+b, you can:
Find y for any x
Plug in the x‑value and simplify.
Example:
y=2x+5
If x=4:
y=2(4)+5=13
Check if a point is on the line
Plug the x‑value from the point into the equation and see if the y‑value matches.
</li>
       <li>6.3 Equations of Parallel and Perpendicular Lines
Parallel Lines
Have the same slope
Different y‑intercepts
Example:
 If a line has slope m=4, any parallel line also has slope 4.
Perpendicular Lines
Slopes are opposite reciprocals
Flip the slope
Change the sign
Example:
 If slope = 2/3, then a perpendicular slope is -3/2
</li>
       <li>6.4 Fitting a Line to Data (Linear Models)
When given a set of data points:
Plot the points on a coordinate plane
Look for a general trend (increasing, decreasing, or constant)
Draw a line that best represents the pattern — this is a line of best fit
Write the equation of the line
Use the equation to make predictions
Example:
 If the data shows a steady increase, the line will have a positive slope.

  <h2>7. Solving and Graphing Linear Inequalities</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>7.1 Inequalities (Meaning + Symbols)<br>
      Inequalities compare values instead of setting them equal. The symbols mean:<br>
      • &lt; less than • &gt; greater than • ≤ less than or equal to • ≥ greater than or equal to<br><br>
      A solution set is the set of all values that make the inequality true. Unlike equations (often 1 solution), inequalities usually have many solutions.<br><br>
      Number line notation:<br>
      • Open circle = not included (for &lt; or &gt;)<br>
      • Closed circle = included (for ≤ or ≥)<br>
      • Shade/arrow shows all values in the solution set.
    </li>

    <li>7.2 Solving One-Step / Two-Step Inequalities<br>
      Solve inequalities like equations: isolate the variable using inverse operations.<br>
      Key rule: If you multiply or divide by a negative, you must flip the inequality sign.<br><br>
      Examples of “flip” situations:<br>
      • −3x &gt; 12 ⇒ x &lt; −4 (sign flips because ÷ −3)<br>
      • x/−5 ≤ 2 ⇒ x ≥ −10<br><br>
      After solving, it’s smart to check with a test value to make sure your solution makes sense.
    </li>

    <li>7.3 Multi-Step Inequalities<br>
      Multi-step inequalities combine several skills:<br>
      1) Distribute (if parentheses exist)<br>
      2) Combine like terms on each side<br>
      3) Move variable terms to one side (add/subtract)<br>
      4) Move constants to the other side<br>
      5) Divide/multiply to isolate the variable (flip if negative!)<br><br>
      Tip: Treat it like solving an equation, but keep watching for the “flip rule.”
    </li>

    <li>7.4 Absolute Value Equations (and how they relate)<br>
      Absolute value measures distance from 0, so it is always nonnegative.<br><br>
      If |x| = a (where a ≥ 0), then there are two solutions:<br>
      x = a or x = −a<br><br>
      Examples:<br>
      • |x| = 7 ⇒ x = 7 or x = −7<br>
      • |x − 3| = 5 ⇒ x − 3 = 5 or x − 3 = −5 ⇒ x = 8 or x = −2<br><br>
      If a &lt; 0, there is no solution because absolute value can’t be negative.
    </li>

    <li>7.5 Linear Inequalities in Two Variables (Graphing)<br>
      These look like: y &gt; mx + b or Ax + By ≤ C. The solution is a region on the graph.<br><br>
      Steps:<br>
      1) Put in slope-intercept form if possible (solve for y).<br>
      2) Graph the boundary line:<br>
         • Solid line for ≤ or ≥ (boundary included)<br>
         • Dashed line for &lt; or &gt; (boundary not included)<br>
      3) Shade the correct side:<br>
         • y &gt; … shade above the line<br>
         • y &lt; … shade below the line<br><br>
      Test-point method: Plug in (0,0) (if it’s not on the line). If it makes the inequality true, shade the side containing (0,0).

  <h2>8. Systems of Equations and Inequalities</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>8.1 Solving Systems by Graphing<br>
      A system is two (or more) equations considered at the same time. The solution is where both are true.<br><br>
      Graphing method:<br>
      1) Graph both lines accurately (slope + intercept helps).<br>
      2) The intersection point is the solution (x, y).<br><br>
      Pros: Visual and easy to understand.<br>
      Cons: Can be inaccurate if intersection is not at a clean point.
    </li>

    <li>8.2 Solving Systems by Substitution<br>
      Best when a variable is already isolated or easy to isolate (x = … or y = …).<br><br>
      Steps:<br>
      1) Solve one equation for one variable.<br>
      2) Substitute that expression into the other equation.<br>
      3) Solve the resulting one-variable equation.<br>
      4) Plug back in to find the second variable.<br>
      5) Write your solution as an ordered pair.<br><br>
      Tip: Always check by plugging (x, y) into both original equations.
    </li>

    <li>8.3 Solving Systems by Elimination (Addition/Subtraction)<br>
      Best when terms line up nicely (same coefficients) or can be made to line up.<br><br>
      Steps:<br>
      1) Line up equations by x and y terms.<br>
      2) Multiply one or both equations if needed so one variable has opposite coefficients.<br>
      3) Add/subtract equations to eliminate that variable.<br>
      4) Solve for the remaining variable.<br>
      5) Substitute back to find the other variable.<br><br>
      Common mistake: Multiply the entire equation (every term), not just one part.
    </li>

    <li>8.4 Special Systems (No Solution / Infinite Solutions)<br>
      After solving, you may get a statement that tells you the system is “special.”<br><br>
      No solution: You end up with something false like 0 = 5.<br>
      • Graph meaning: lines are parallel (same slope, different intercept).<br><br>
      Infinite solutions: You end up with something true like 0 = 0.<br>
      • Graph meaning: lines are the same line (coincident).<br><br>
      One solution: Most common — intersection at one point.
    </li>

    <li>8.5 Systems of Inequalities<br>
      Each inequality gives a shaded region. The solution to the system is the region where all shadings overlap.<br><br>
      Steps:<br>
      1) Graph each boundary line (solid or dashed).<br>
      2) Shade the correct side for each inequality.<br>
      3) The overlap region is the solution set.<br><br>
      Solutions are often written as a shaded area (not a single point).

  <h2>9. Exponents</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>9.1 Expanding vs. Condensing Exponents<br>
      Expand means rewrite using repeated multiplication (helpful for seeing patterns).<br>
      Example: x^4 = x·x·x·x<br><br>
      Condense means rewrite using exponent form (shorter, cleaner).<br>
      Example: a·a·a·a·a = a^5<br><br>
      Expanding is useful for understanding rules, but condensing is better for final answers.
    </li>

    <li>9.2 Core Exponent Rules (Same Base)<br>
      These rules only work cleanly when the bases match.<br><br>
      • Product: a^m · a^n = a^(m+n)<br>
      • Quotient: a^m / a^n = a^(m−n) (a ≠ 0)<br>
      • Power of a Power: (a^m)^n = a^(mn)<br>
      • Power of a Product: (ab)^n = a^n b^n<br>
      • Power of a Quotient: (a/b)^n = a^n / b^n (b ≠ 0)<br><br>
      Common mistake: (a + b)^2 ≠ a^2 + b^2. You must FOIL.
    </li>

    <li>9.3 Zero and Negative Exponents<br>
      • Zero exponent: a^0 = 1 (as long as a ≠ 0)<br>
      • Negative exponent: a^−n = 1 / a^n<br><br>
      Negative exponents mean “move across the fraction bar.”<br>
      Example: x^−3 = 1/x^3 and 1/x^−2 = x^2
    </li>

    <li>9.4 Scientific Notation<br>
      Scientific notation writes numbers as: a × 10^n where 1 ≤ a &lt; 10.<br><br>
      • Move decimal left ⇒ n is positive (big numbers)<br>
      • Move decimal right ⇒ n is negative (small numbers)<br><br>
      Examples:<br>
      • 4,500,000 = 4.5 × 10^6<br>
      • 0.00032 = 3.2 × 10^−4<br><br>
      Operations:<br>
      • Multiply: multiply a-values, add exponents of 10<br>

      Steps:<br>
      1) List factor pairs of c<br>
      2) Pick the pair that adds to b<br>
      3) Write as (x + m)(x + n)<br><br>

      2) Find two numbers that multiply to a·c and add to b<br>
      3) Split the middle term into two terms<br>
      4) Factor by grouping<br><br>
      Example: 2x^2 + 7x + 3<br>
      a·c = 6, numbers: 6 and 1 ⇒ 2x^2 + 6x + x + 3 ⇒ 2x(x+3) + 1(x+3) ⇒ (2x+1)(x+3)
    </li>

    <li>10.6 Factoring Special Products<br>
      Difference of Squares: a^2 − b^2 = (a − b)(a + b)<br>
      Example: x^2 − 16 = (x − 4)(x + 4)<br><br>
      Perfect Square Trinomials:<br>
      a^2 + 2ab + b^2 = (a + b)^2<br>
      a^2 − 2ab + b^2 = (a − b)^2<br>
      Example: x^2 + 10x + 25 = (x + 5)^2<br><br>

      A radical is simplified when there are no perfect-square factors left under the root.<br><br>
      Method:<br>
      1) Factor the radicand (number under the root).<br>
      2) Pull out perfect squares because √(a^2) = |a| (in Algebra 1 usually treat as a for a≥0).<br>
      3) Multiply what comes out by what stays inside.<br><br>
      Examples:<br>
      • √50 = √(25·2) = 5√2<br>
      • √(72x^2) = √(36·2·x^2) = 6x√2 (assuming x ≥ 0)
    </li>

    <li>11.2 Operations with Square Roots<br>
      Add/Subtract: Only combine like radicals (same radical part).<br>
      Example: 3√5 + 2√5 = 5√5, but √2 + √3 cannot combine.<br><br>
      Multiply: √a · √b = √(ab)<br>
      Example: √6 · √15 = √90 = 3√10<br><br>
      Divide: √a / √b = √(a/b) (b ≠ 0), and you often simplify after.<br><br>

      x-coordinate of vertex: x = −b/(2a)<br>
      Plug that x into the function to get y (vertex y-value).<br>
      Axis of symmetry is the vertical line x = −b/(2a).<br><br>
      Once you have vertex, find a few symmetric points to complete the graph.
    </li>

    <li>12.2 Solving Quadratics by Graphing<br>
      The solutions to ax² + bx + c = 0 are the x-intercepts of the parabola.<br><br>
      • If the graph crosses the x-axis twice → 2 real solutions<br>
      • If it touches once (tangent) → 1 real solution (double root)<br>
      • If it never touches → 0 real solutions (no real roots)<br><br>
      Graphing gives approximate solutions unless intercepts land exactly on grid points.
    </li>

    <li>12.3 Solving Quadratics using Square Roots<br>
      Works best when there is no x-term after rearranging (or after completing the square).<br><br>
      Steps:<br>
      1) Isolate x² (and the constant) on one side.<br>
      2) Take the square root of both sides: x = ±√(number).<br>
      3) Solve for x if needed.<br><br>
      Example idea: (x − 3)^2 = 16 ⇒ x − 3 = ±4 ⇒ x = 7 or x = −1
    </li>

    <li>12.4 Quadratic Formula<br>
      Works for any quadratic equation in standard form ax² + bx + c = 0:<br>
      x = [−b ± √(b² − 4ac)] / (2a)<br><br>
      Discriminant: D = b² − 4ac tells you how many solutions:<br>
      • D &gt; 0 → 2 real solutions<br>
      • D = 0 → 1 real solution<br>
      • D &lt; 0 → no real solutions (complex in Algebra 2)<br><br>
      Tip: Always write a, b, c carefully (sign mistakes are the #1 error).

    <h2>1. Tools for Geometry</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1.1 Points, Lines, and Planes<br>
        A point is an exact location (no size). A line extends forever in both directions. A plane is a flat surface that extends forever.<br><br>
        Useful ideas:<br>
        • Two points determine exactly one line.<br>
        • Three noncollinear points determine exactly one plane.<br>
        • A segment has two endpoints (finite). A ray has one endpoint (infinite one direction).<br><br>
        Example: If points A and B are given, there is exactly one line through them (line AB). If points A, B, C are not in a straight line, they define a plane.
      </li>

      <li>1.2 Measuring Segments<br>
        Segment length on a number line is the absolute difference: |x2 − x1|.<br>
        On a coordinate plane, use distance: √((x2 − x1)^2 + (y2 − y1)^2).<br><br>
        Example (number line): A at 2, B at 9 → AB = |9 − 2| = 7.<br>
        Example (coordinate plane): A(1,2), B(5,5) → AB = √((5−1)^2 + (5−2)^2) = √(16+9) = √25 = 5.
      </li>

      <li>1.3 Measuring Angles<br>
        Angles are measured in degrees (°). Types: acute (&lt;90°), right (=90°), obtuse (&gt;90° and &lt;180°), straight (=180°).<br><br>
        Example: If m∠ABC = 35°, the angle is acute. If m∠ABC = 120°, the angle is obtuse.
      </li>

      <li>1.4 Segment and Angle Addition Postulates<br>
        Segment Addition: If B is between A and C, then AB + BC = AC.<br>
        Angle Addition: If D is inside ∠ABC, then m∠ABD + m∠DBC = m∠ABC.<br><br>
        Example (segments): If AB = 6 and BC = 4, then AC = 10.<br>
        Example (angles): If m∠ABD = 25° and m∠DBC = 40°, then m∠ABC = 65°.
      </li>

      <li>1.5 Angle Pairs<br>
        Complementary angles add to 90°. Supplementary angles add to 180°.<br>
        Vertical angles are opposite angles formed by intersecting lines (they are congruent). Adjacent angles share a side and vertex and do not overlap.<br><br>
        Example (complementary): If one angle is 32°, the complement is 58° (because 32+58=90).<br>
        Example (supplementary): If one angle is 115°, the supplement is 65° (because 115+65=180).<br>
        Example (vertical): If a vertical angle is 47°, its vertical partner is also 47°.

    <h2>2. Reasoning and Proofs</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2.1 Reasoning and Proof (Inductive vs. Deductive)<br>
        Inductive reasoning uses patterns/examples to make a conjecture (a prediction). It can be wrong if there is a counterexample.<br>
        Deductive reasoning uses definitions, postulates, and theorems to prove a statement must be true.<br><br>
        Example (inductive): 2,4,6,8… → conjecture: “add 2 each time.”<br>
        Example (counterexample idea): Conjecture: “All prime numbers are odd.” Counterexample: 2 is prime and even.<br>
        Example (deductive): If all right angles are congruent and ∠A and ∠B are right angles, then ∠A ≅ ∠B.
      </li>

      <li>2.2 Intro to Proofs (How to Write One)<br>
        Proofs show a logical chain from given information to what you must prove. Common formats: two-column and paragraph proofs.<br>
        Reasons usually come from: given, definition, properties of equality, postulates, and theorems.<br><br>
        Example structure (two-column idea):<br>
        Given: AB = CD, CD = EF. Prove: AB = EF.<br>
        Steps: AB = CD (given), CD = EF (given), so AB = EF (transitive property).
      </li>

      <li>2.3 More with Proofs (Common Reasons to Use)<br>
        Common properties:<br>
        • Reflexive: a = a<br>
        • Symmetric: if a = b then b = a<br>
        • Transitive: if a = b and b = c then a = c<br>
        • Substitution: replace equals with equals<br>
        Common definitions: midpoint, bisector, perpendicular, parallel, congruent segments/angles.<br><br>
        Example (midpoint): If M is midpoint of AB, then AM = MB (definition of midpoint).<br>
        Example (angle bisector): If ray BD bisects ∠ABC, then m∠ABD = m∠DBC.

    <h2>3. Parallel and Perpendicular Lines</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>3.1 Lines and Angles with Transversals<br>
        A transversal intersects two lines and creates angle pairs: corresponding, alternate interior/exterior, and same-side interior.<br><br>
        Example: If two parallel lines are cut by a transversal and one corresponding angle is 68°, then the matching corresponding angle is also 68°.
      </li>

      <li>3.2 Properties of Parallel Lines<br>
        If lines are parallel:<br>
        • Corresponding angles are congruent.<br>
        • Alternate interior angles are congruent.<br>
        • Alternate exterior angles are congruent.<br>
        • Same-side interior angles are supplementary (sum to 180°).<br><br>
        Example: If alternate interior angles are (3x + 10)° and (5x − 30)°, then set them equal:<br>
        3x + 10 = 5x − 30 → 40 = 2x → x = 20.
      </li>

      <li>3.3 Proving Lines Parallel<br>
        To prove two lines are parallel, show one of the special parallel-line angle relationships is true (converse theorems).<br><br>
        Example: If corresponding angles are equal (like 110° and 110°), then the lines must be parallel.
      </li>

      <li>3.4 Parallel Lines and Triangles<br>
        Parallel lines can create equal angles that help with triangle angle facts (triangle sum 180°, exterior angle theorem) and can lead to triangle similarity later.<br><br>
        Example: If a line is parallel to one side of a triangle, angles formed can be corresponding/alternate interior, letting you match angles inside the triangle.
      </li>

      <li>3.5 Equations of Lines in the Coordinate Plane<br>
        Slope: m = (y2 − y1)/(x2 − x1). Forms: y = mx + b and y − y1 = m(x − x1).<br><br>
        Example (slope): Points (2,1) and (6,9) → m = (9−1)/(6−2) = 8/4 = 2.<br>
        Example (point-slope): Through (3,−1) with slope 2 → y + 1 = 2(x − 3) → y = 2x − 7.
      </li>

      <li>3.6 Slopes of Parallel and Perpendicular Lines<br>
        Parallel lines have the same slope. Perpendicular lines have opposite reciprocal slopes (m1·m2 = −1) when defined.<br><br>
        Example (parallel): If a line has slope 4, any parallel line has slope 4.<br>
        Example (perpendicular): If slope is 3/5, perpendicular slope is −5/3.

    <h2>4. Triangle Congruence</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>4.1 Triangles (Types + Key Facts)<br>
        Side types: equilateral (3 equal sides), isosceles (at least 2 equal), scalene (none equal).<br>
        Angle types: acute, right, obtuse.<br>
        Triangle Sum: angles add to 180°.<br><br>
        Example (triangle sum): If angles are 50° and 60°, third angle = 180 − 110 = 70°.<br>
        Example (isosceles): If two sides are congruent, the base angles are congruent (so if one base angle is 38°, the other is 38°).
      </li>

      <li>4.2 SSS and SAS Congruence<br>
        SSS: three sides match. SAS: two sides and the included angle match.<br><br>
        Example (SSS): If AB = DE, BC = EF, AC = DF, then △ABC ≅ △DEF by SSS.<br>
        Example (SAS): If AB = DE, ∠B = ∠E, BC = EF (and the angle is between the sides), then triangles are congruent by SAS.
      </li>

      <li>4.3 ASA and AAS Congruence<br>
        ASA: two angles and the included side match. AAS: two angles and a non-included side match.<br><br>
        Example (ASA): If ∠A = ∠D, ∠B = ∠E, and AB = DE, then △ABC ≅ △DEF by ASA.<br>
        Example (AAS): If ∠A = ∠D, ∠C = ∠F, and AC = DF, then △ABC ≅ △DEF by AAS.
      </li>

      <li>4.4 CPCTC and HL<br>
        CPCTC: once triangles are proven congruent, corresponding sides/angles are equal.<br>
        HL: right triangles with equal hypotenuse and one leg are congruent.<br><br>
        Example (CPCTC): If △ABC ≅ △DEF, then ∠B = ∠E and BC = EF, etc.<br>
        Example (HL): If two right triangles have hypotenuse 10 and a leg 6, they are congruent by HL.

      <li>5.1 Polygon Angles<br>
        Interior angle sum: (n − 2)×180°.<br>
        Exterior angles (one at each vertex) sum to 360°.<br><br>
        Example: A hexagon (n=6) has interior sum (6−2)×180 = 720°.<br>
        Example (regular pentagon): each exterior angle = 360/5 = 72°. Each interior angle = 180 − 72 = 108°.
      </li>

      <li>5.2 Parallelogram Properties<br>
        In a parallelogram: opposite sides congruent, opposite angles congruent, consecutive angles supplementary, diagonals bisect each other.<br><br>
        Example: If one angle is 115° in a parallelogram, adjacent angle = 65° (supplementary). Opposite angle = 115°.
      </li>

      <li>5.3 Proving Parallelograms (Conditions)<br>
        Prove a quadrilateral is a parallelogram if:<br>
        • both pairs opposite sides parallel, or<br>
        • both pairs opposite sides congruent, or<br>
        • one pair opposite sides both parallel and congruent, or<br>
        • diagonals bisect each other.<br><br>
        Example: If you show AB ∥ CD and AB = CD, then the quadrilateral is a parallelogram.
      </li>

      <li>5.4 Rhombuses and Rectangles<br>
        Rectangle: a parallelogram with four right angles; diagonals are congruent.<br>
        Rhombus: a parallelogram with four equal sides; diagonals are perpendicular and bisect opposite angles.<br>
        Square: both a rectangle and a rhombus.<br><br>
        Example: If a parallelogram has one 90° angle, it is a rectangle (all angles become 90°).<br>
        Example: If a parallelogram has all sides equal, it is a rhombus.
      </li>

      <li>5.5 Proving Rhombuses and Rectangles (Conditions)<br>
        Rectangle proofs often use: one right angle in a parallelogram, or congruent diagonals in a parallelogram.<br>
        Rhombus proofs often use: consecutive sides congruent in a parallelogram, or perpendicular diagonals, or a diagonal bisecting an angle (depending on your theorem set).<br><br>
        Example (rectangle): If diagonals of a parallelogram are congruent, then it is a rectangle.<br>
        Example (rhombus): If diagonals of a parallelogram are perpendicular, then it is a rhombus.
      </li>

      <li>5.6 Kites and Trapezoids<br>
        Kite: two pairs of adjacent equal sides; diagonals are perpendicular; one diagonal bisects the other.<br>
        Trapezoid: at least one pair of parallel sides. Isosceles trapezoid: legs congruent, base angles congruent, diagonals congruent.<br><br>
        Example (isosceles trapezoid): If legs are both 10, then base angles match (top base angles are equal, bottom base angles are equal).

    <h2>6. Similar Figures</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>6.1 Similar Figures<br>
        Similar figures have the same shape: corresponding angles are equal and corresponding sides are proportional.<br>
        Scale factor k tells how sizes change. Perimeter scales by k, area scales by k^2.<br><br>
        Example: If two triangles are similar with scale factor 3 (small → large), a 4-unit side becomes 12 units. If area of small is 10, area of large is 10×3^2 = 90.
      </li>

      <li>6.2 Prove Triangles Similar (AA, SAS, SSS)<br>
        AA: two angles match.<br>
        SAS: two side ratios match and included angle matches.<br>
        SSS: all three side ratios match.<br><br>
        Example (AA): If one triangle has angles 30° and 70° and another has 30° and 70°, then triangles are similar by AA.<br>
        Example (SSS): If side ratios are 2/4, 3/6, 5/10 (all = 1/2), triangles are similar by SSS.
      </li>

      <li>6.3 Side Splitter Theorem<br>
        A line parallel to one side of a triangle divides the other two sides proportionally.<br><br>
        Example: If DE ∥ BC in △ABC, and AD=3, DB=6, then AE/EC = 3/6 = 1/2. If AE=4, then EC=8.

    <ul>
      <li>7.1 Pythagorean Theorem and Converse<br>
        For a right triangle: a^2 + b^2 = c^2 (c is hypotenuse). Converse checks if a triangle is right by testing the equation with the longest side as c.<br><br>
        Example: Legs 6 and 8 → c = √(36+64) = √100 = 10.<br>
        Example (converse): Sides 5,12,13 → 5^2+12^2=25+144=169=13^2, so it is a right triangle.
      </li>

      <li>7.2 Special Right Triangles (45°-45°-90°)<br>
        Side ratio: 1 : 1 : √2. Legs equal. Hypotenuse = leg√2.<br><br>
        Example: If leg = 7, hypotenuse = 7√2.<br>
        Example: If hypotenuse = 10, each leg = 10/√2 = 5√2.
      </li>

      <li>7.3 Special Right Triangles (30°-60°-90°)<br>
        Side ratio: 1 : √3 : 2 (short leg : long leg : hypotenuse). Short leg is opposite 30°.<br><br>
        Example: If short leg = 5, long leg = 5√3 and hypotenuse = 10.<br>
        Example: If hypotenuse = 18, short leg = 9 and long leg = 9√3.
      </li>

      <li>7.4 Trig Ratios<br>
        sin(θ)=opposite/hypotenuse, cos(θ)=adjacent/hypotenuse, tan(θ)=opposite/adjacent.<br><br>
        Example: In a right triangle, relative to angle θ, opposite=9 and hypotenuse=15 → sin(θ)=9/15=3/5.<br>
        Example: If opposite=6 and adjacent=8 → tan(θ)=6/8=3/4.

        Use inverse trig to find angles from ratios (calculator in degree mode).<br><br>

    <h2>11. Circles</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>11.1 Tangents to Circles<br>
        A tangent touches a circle at one point. The radius to the point of tangency is perpendicular to the tangent.<br>
        Tangent segments from the same external point are equal length.<br><br>
        Example: If PT and PS are tangents from point P, then PT = PS.
      </li>

      <li>11.2 Chords and Arcs<br>
        A chord has endpoints on the circle. Equal chords intercept equal arcs (and vice versa). The perpendicular bisector of a chord goes through the center.<br><br>
        Example: If chord AB = chord CD, then arc AB = arc CD.
      </li>

      <li>11.3 Intercepted Arcs (Central and Inscribed Angles)<br>
        Central angle measure equals intercepted arc measure.<br>
        Inscribed angle measure equals half of intercepted arc measure.<br><br>
        Example: If an inscribed angle intercepts a 120° arc, the angle measure is 60°.<br>
        Example: If a central angle is 75°, the intercepted arc is 75°.
      </li>

      <li>11.4 Secants and Tangents (Angle Formulas)<br>
        If the angle’s vertex is outside the circle (secant-secant or tangent-secant): angle = 1/2(outer arc − inner arc).<br>
        If chords intersect inside: angle = 1/2(sum of intercepted arcs).<br><br>
        Example (outside): outer arc 160°, inner arc 40° → angle = 1/2(160−40)=60°.<br>
        Example (inside): intercepted arcs 90° and 50° → angle = 1/2(90+50)=70°.

    <ul>
      <li>12.1 Introduction to Probability<br>
        Probability = favorable outcomes / total outcomes. Values range from 0 to 1 (or 0% to 100%).<br><br>
        Example: Rolling a die, P(roll a 5) = 1/6. P(roll an even number) = 3/6 = 1/2.
      </li>

      <li>12.2 More Probability (Compound Events)<br>
        Independent events: P(A and B) = P(A)×P(B).<br>
        Mutually exclusive events: P(A or B) = P(A)+P(B).<br>
        General addition rule: P(A or B) = P(A)+P(B)−P(A and B).<br><br>
        Example (independent): Flip a coin and roll a die. P(heads and 6) = (1/2)×(1/6)=1/12.<br>
        Example (mutually exclusive): On a die, events “roll 2” and “roll 5” → P(2 or 5)=1/6+1/6=2/6=1/3.

    <h2>Unit 1 - Algebra Basics</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1.1 Return to Algebra (Expressions + Properties + Order of Operations)<br>
        Review how to simplify expressions using PEMDAS: parentheses, exponents, multiply/divide, add/subtract.<br>
        Common properties used in Algebra 2:<br>
        • Commutative: a+b=b+a, ab=ba<br>
        • Associative: (a+b)+c=a+(b+c), (ab)c=a(bc)<br>
        • Distributive: a(b+c)=ab+ac<br><br>
        Example: 3(2x − 5) + 4x = 6x − 15 + 4x = 10x − 15.
      </li>

      <li>1.2 Solving Equations and Inequalities<br>
        To solve equations, isolate the variable using inverse operations. For multi-step problems: distribute first, combine like terms, then move terms.<br>
        For inequalities, solve the same way, but flip the inequality sign when you multiply or divide by a negative.<br><br>
        Example (equation): 5x − 7 = 18 → 5x = 25 → x = 5.<br>
        Example (inequality): −2x + 3 ≥ 11 → −2x ≥ 8 → x ≤ −4 (flip sign when dividing by −2).
      </li>

      <li>1.3 Absolute Value Equations<br>
        Absolute value is distance from 0, so it is never negative.<br>
        If |x| = a (a ≥ 0), then x = a or x = −a.<br>
        If |x| = negative number, there is no solution.<br><br>
        Example: |x − 4| = 9 → x − 4 = 9 or x − 4 = −9 → x = 13 or x = −5.
      </li>

      <li>1.4 Rewriting Equations (Solve for a Specific Variable)<br>
        Rearranging means isolating a chosen variable using inverse operations, like solving an equation but keeping other variables.<br><br>
        Example: Solve for y: 3x + 2y = 10 → 2y = 10 − 3x → y = (10 − 3x)/2.<br>
        Example: Solve for r: A = πr^2 → r^2 = A/π → r = √(A/π).

    <h2>Unit 2 - Linear Functions</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2.1 Function Notation<br>
        A function takes an input and produces exactly one output. f(x) is read “f of x” and means the output when the input is x.<br><br>
        Example: If f(x)=2x+3, then f(4)=2(4)+3=11.
      </li>

      <li>2.2 Represent Functions and Relations<br>
        A relation is any set of ordered pairs. A function is a relation where each input x has only one output y.<br>
        Ways to represent: table, graph, mapping diagram, equation/rule.<br><br>
        Vertical line test (graphs): if any vertical line hits the graph more than once, it is not a function.<br><br>
        Example: (2,5) and (2,7) in the same relation means it is not a function (input 2 gives two outputs).
      </li>

      <li>2.3 Find Slope and Rate of Change<br>
        Slope is rate of change: m = (change in y)/(change in x) = (y2 − y1)/(x2 − x1).<br>
        Positive slope rises left to right. Negative slope falls. Zero slope is horizontal. Undefined slope is vertical.<br><br>
        Example: Points (1,2) and (5,10): m=(10−2)/(5−1)=8/4=2.
      </li>

      <li>2.4 Graph Equations of Lines<br>
        Common ways to graph:<br>
        • Slope-intercept: y=mx+b (plot b, then use slope)<br>
        • Point-slope: y−y1=m(x−x1) (use point and slope)<br>
        • Two points (plot both and draw the line)<br><br>
        Example: y=−3x+6 has y-intercept 6 and slope −3 (down 3, right 1).
      </li>

      <li>2.5 Writing Equations of Lines<br>
        Use slope-intercept form y=mx+b when you know m and b, or point-slope y−y1=m(x−x1) when you know a point and slope.<br><br>
        Example: Through (2,−1) with slope 4:<br>
        y+1=4(x−2) → y=4x−9.

    <h2>Unit 3 - Absolute Value & Piecewise Functions</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>3.1 Absolute Value Inequalities<br>
        Absolute value inequalities describe values within or outside a distance from a point.<br>
        |x| &lt; a means x is between −a and a: −a &lt; x &lt; a.<br>
        |x| &gt; a means x is outside that range: x &lt; −a or x &gt; a.<br><br>
        Example: |x − 2| ≤ 5 → −5 ≤ x − 2 ≤ 5 → −3 ≤ x ≤ 7.<br>
        Example: |2x + 1| &gt; 7 → 2x+1 &gt; 7 or 2x+1 &lt; −7 → x &gt; 3 or x &lt; −4.
      </li>

      <li>3.2 Absolute Value Graphs<br>
        y=|x| is a V-shape with vertex at (0,0). For y=|x−h|+k, the vertex shifts to (h,k).<br>
        A number outside stretches/shrinks; a negative reflects over the x-axis.<br><br>
        Example: y=|x−3|+2 has vertex (3,2).<br>
        Example: y=−2|x| has vertex (0,0) and opens downward (reflected) with steeper sides (stretched by 2).
      </li>

      <li>3.3 Piecewise Functions<br>
        Piecewise functions use different rules for different x-intervals. Always pay attention to the condition symbols (&lt;, ≤, &gt;, ≥).<br>
        When graphing, use open circles for &lt; or &gt; and closed circles for ≤ or ≥ at endpoints.<br><br>
        Example:<br>
        f(x)= { x+1 if x&lt;0<br>
        { 2x−3 if x≥0<br>
        Then f(−2)=−2+1=−1, and f(4)=2(4)−3=5.

    <h2>Unit 4 - Linear Systems of Equations</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>4.1 Solving Linear Systems Graphically<br>
        Graph both lines; the solution is their intersection point (x,y).<br>
        One solution: lines cross once. No solution: parallel lines. Infinite solutions: same line.<br><br>
        Example: If y=2x+1 and y=2x−3, they are parallel (same slope), so no solution.
      </li>

      <li>4.2 Solving Linear Systems Algebraically (Substitution/Elimination)<br>
        Substitution: solve one equation for a variable, substitute into the other.<br>
        Elimination: add/subtract equations to eliminate one variable (may need to multiply first).<br><br>
        Example (substitution): y=x+2 and 2x+y=10 → 2x+(x+2)=10 → 3x=8 → x=8/3 → y=14/3.<br>
        Example (elimination): x+y=7 and x−y=1 → add: 2x=8 → x=4 → y=3.
      </li>

      <li>4.3 Systems of Linear Inequalities<br>
        Graph each inequality; the solution is the overlapping shaded region.<br>

    <ul>
      <li>5.1 Graph Quadratics in Vertex Form<br>
        Vertex form: y=a(x−h)^2+k. Vertex is (h,k). a controls opening and width (a&gt;0 up, a&lt;0 down).<br><br>
        Example: y=2(x−1)^2−3 has vertex (1,−3) and opens up, narrower than y=x^2.
      </li>

      <li>5.2 Graph Quadratics in Standard Form<br>
        Standard form: y=ax^2+bx+c. The axis of symmetry is x=−b/(2a). Plug that x in to find the vertex y-value.<br>
        c is the y-intercept (0,c).<br><br>
        Example: y=x^2−6x+5 → axis x=−(−6)/(2)=3. Vertex y=3^2−18+5=−4, so vertex (3,−4).
      </li>

      <li>5.3 Solving Quadratics by Factoring<br>
        Write the equation in standard form = 0, factor, then use zero product property: if (p)(q)=0, then p=0 or q=0.<br><br>
        Example: x^2−5x+6=0 → (x−2)(x−3)=0 → x=2 or x=3.
      </li>

      <li>5.4 Factoring with GCF and Difference of Squares<br>
        GCF: factor out the greatest common factor first.<br>
        Difference of squares: a^2−b^2=(a−b)(a+b).<br><br>
        Example (GCF): 6x^2+9x = 3x(2x+3).<br>
        Example (DoS): x^2−49=(x−7)(x+7).
      </li>

      <li>5.5 Solving Quadratics by Square Roots<br>
        Works best when the x-term is gone: isolate (x−h)^2 or x^2, then take ±√ both sides.<br><br>
        Example: (x−4)^2=25 → x−4=±5 → x=9 or x=−1.

        i is defined as √(−1). Then i^2=−1, i^3=−i, i^4=1 (powers of i repeat every 4).<br>
        Complex numbers have the form a+bi.<br><br>
        Example: √(−16)=4i. Example: (3−2i) is complex with real part 3 and imaginary part −2.
      </li>

      <li>6.2 Operations on Complex Numbers<br>
        Add/subtract: combine like terms (real with real, imaginary with imaginary).<br>
        Multiply: distribute/FOIL, then use i^2=−1.<br>
        Divide: multiply numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator (a−bi).<br><br>
        Example (multiply): (2+i)(3−4i)=6−8i+3i−4i^2=6−5i+4=10−5i.<br>
        Example (divide): (4+2i)/(1−i) × (1+i)/(1+i) = (4+4i+2i+2i^2)/(1+1) = (4+6i−2)/2 = 1+3i.
      </li>

      <li>6.3 Completing the Square<br>
        Used to solve quadratics and rewrite into vertex form.<br>
        Steps: move constant, make coefficient of x^2 be 1 (divide if needed), add (b/2)^2 inside the parentheses, balance both sides, then factor into a square.<br><br>
        Example: x^2+6x−7=0 → x^2+6x=7 → x^2+6x+9=16 → (x+3)^2=16 → x=1 or x=−7.

        Inverses “undo” each other: f(f^−1(x))=x. To find an inverse: replace f(x) with y, swap x and y, solve for y, then rename as f^−1(x).<br><br>
        Example: y=2x+5 → swap: x=2y+5 → y=(x−5)/2, so f^−1(x)=(x−5)/2.

        Parabola in vertex form: y=a(x−h)^2+k with vertex (h,k). It opens up/down based on sign of a. Parabolas can also be written as (x−h)^2=4p(y−k) where p relates to focus/directrix distance.<br><br>
        Example: y=(x−2)^2−1 has vertex (2,−1) and opens up.
      </li>

      <li>11.2 Ellipses and Circles<br>
        Circle: (x−h)^2+(y−k)^2=r^2 (center (h,k), radius r).<br>
        Ellipse: (x−h)^2/a^2 + (y−k)^2/b^2 = 1 (a and b control major/minor axes). The bigger denominator is along the major axis direction.<br><br>
        Example (circle): (x−1)^2+(y+3)^2=16 has center (1,−3) and radius 4.
      </li>

      <li>11.3 Hyperbolas<br>
        Hyperbolas have two branches and asymptotes. Forms:<br>
        (x−h)^2/a^2 − (y−k)^2/b^2 = 1 (opens left/right)<br>
        (y−k)^2/a^2 − (x−h)^2/b^2 = 1 (opens up/down)<br>
        Asymptotes (when centered at origin): y=±(b/a)x (adjust with shifts for (h,k)).<br><br>
        Example: x^2/9 − y^2/4 = 1 has asymptotes y=±(2/3)x.
      </li>

      <li>11.4 Classifying Conics from General Form<br>
        General form: Ax^2 + Bxy + Cy^2 + Dx + Ey + F = 0.<br>
        If A=C and B=0 → circle. If A and C are positive but not equal → ellipse. If A and C have opposite signs → hyperbola. If one of A or C is 0 (and the other isn’t) → parabola (common Algebra 2 case).<br><br>
        Example: x^2+4y^2=16 is an ellipse (both squared terms, different coefficients).

    <h2>Unit 12 - Matrices</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>12.1 Matrix Operations<br>
        Matrices are rectangular arrays of numbers. You can only add/subtract matrices of the same dimensions, and you do it entry-by-entry. Scalar multiplication multiplies every entry by a constant.<br><br>
        Example: [1 2; 3 4] + [5 6; 7 8] = [6 8; 10 12].<br>
        Example: 3[1 −2; 0 5] = [3 −6; 0 15].
      </li>

      <li>12.2 Matrix Multiplication<br>
        Multiply row by column. The number of columns in the first matrix must equal the number of rows in the second. Order matters (AB≠BA usually).<br><br>
        Example: [1 2; 3 4] · [5; 6] = [1·5+2·6; 3·5+4·6] = [17; 39].
      </li>

      <li>12.3 Inverse Matrices<br>
        A is invertible if there is a matrix A^−1 such that AA^−1 = I (identity matrix). Only square matrices can have inverses. In Algebra 2, inverses are often used to solve systems.<br><br>
        Example idea: If AX=B, then X=A^−1B.
      </li>

      <li>12.4 Encoding Messages (Simple Encryption Idea)<br>
        Encoding can use matrix multiplication: message matrix × key matrix = coded matrix. Decoding multiplies by the inverse key (if it exists).<br><br>
        Example idea: If key K encodes, then K^−1 decodes. Multiply encoded data by K^−1 to recover the original message.
